## Background

The field of machine learning has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the development of various frameworks, tools, and platforms to support the ML lifecycle. However, the lack of standardization and interoperability among these tools has led to challenges in reproducing, sharing, and governing ML workflows across different environments and organizations.

### Foundational Work

MLSpec builds upon the ideas and concepts from the foundational work in the field of ML workflow specification and verification. Some notable contributions include:

- [Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language)
- [Portable Format for Analytics (PFA)](https://dmg.org/pfa/)
- [ML Metadata](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd)

These projects have paved the way for standardizing ML model serialization and metadata, but they primarily focus on individual models rather than end-to-end workflows.

MLSpec also draws inspiration from the MLSchema project, which has made significant contributions to the field of ML workflow specification. Due to the instability of the original MLSchema website, we have mirrored some of their key resources here:

- [MLSchema Paper](https://github.com/mlspec/MLSpec/blob/master/1807.05351.pdf)
- [MLSchema Core Specification](https://github.com/mlspec/MLSpec/blob/master/ML%20Schema%20Core%20Specification.pdf)

These resources provide valuable insights into the design principles and approaches behind ML workflow specification and have influenced the development of MLSpec.

### Existing Multi-Stage ML Workflows

Several prominent companies and organizations have developed their own multi-stage ML workflow solutions to address the challenges of managing end-to-end machine learning pipelines. These projects have focused on combining ML and batch processing capabilities to create robust and scalable workflows.

Some notable examples of these multi-stage ML workflow solutions include:

From studying these projects and their associated papers, we have identified a set of common steps that encompass the end-to-end machine learning workflow. These steps include data ingestion, data preparation, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, model deployment, and monitoring.

MLSpec aims to provide a standardized specification and framework for defining and executing these multi-stage ML workflows, drawing inspiration from the successful approaches and best practices established by these industry leaders.

# Specificiation 

## MLSpec Standards

MLSpec aims to establish a set of standards for various components involved in an end-to-end machine learning workflow. By defining these standards, MLSpec seeks to promote interoperability, reproducibility, and best practices across different ML tools and platforms.

The standards cover the following key areas:

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: MLSpec will define a standard set of endpoints that each step in an ML workflow should expose. These endpoints may include:
   - `/ok`: An endpoint to check the health and readiness of the step.
   - `/varz`: An endpoint to retrieve various runtime variables and configurations.
   - `/metrics`: An endpoint to expose performance metrics and monitoring data.
   - Additional endpoints for step-specific functionality and control.

   By standardizing these endpoints, MLSpec enables consistent monitoring, control, and integration of ML workflow steps across different orchestration platforms.

2. **Model Management**: MLSpec will provide guidelines and standards for versioning, packaging, and deploying ML models. This may include:
   - Model serialization formats and conventions.
   - Metadata schemas for capturing model provenance, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
   - APIs for model serving and inference.
   - Best practices for model versioning and lineage tracking.

   Standardizing model management practices promotes model reproducibility, interpretability, and maintainability.

3. **Logging**: MLSpec will define a standard logging format for capturing relevant information about each inference request. This logging format will align with the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) standard log format, which includes fields such as:
   - Timestamp
   - Request ID
   - User ID
   - Model version
   - Input data
   - Output predictions
   - Latency
   - Additional metadata

   Adopting a standardized logging format enables consistent monitoring, debugging, and analysis of ML system behavior.

4. **Data Validation and Quality**: MLSpec will provide guidelines and standards for validating and ensuring the quality of input data at various stages of the ML workflow. This may include:
   - Data schema validation.
   - Data quality checks (e.g., missing values, outliers, data drift).
   - Data versioning and lineage tracking.
   - Integration with data validation frameworks and tools.

   Ensuring data quality and validation helps maintain the integrity and reliability of ML workflows.

5. **Experiment Tracking**: MLSpec will define standards for tracking and managing ML experiments, including:
   - Experiment metadata schemas.
   - APIs for logging and querying experiment runs.
   - Best practices for organizing and versioning experiment artifacts.
   - Integration with popular experiment tracking frameworks.

   Standardizing experiment tracking enables reproducibility, comparison, and analysis of ML experiments.

By establishing standards across these critical components of the ML workflow, MLSpec aims to foster a more robust, interoperable, and governed ecosystem for machine learning development and deployment.

## End-to-End Complete Lifecycle

With MLSpec, we believe that every stage of an ML lifecycle requires some form of metadata management. We have identified the following steps as critical components of a complete ML lifecycle:

1. **Codify Objectives**: Detail the model outputs, possible errors, and minimum success criteria for launching in code. Use a simple DSL that can be used to verify success/failure programmatically for automated deployment.

2. **Data Ingestion**: Specify the tools/connectors (e.g., ODBC, Spark, HDFS, CSV, etc.) used for pulling in data, along with the queries used (including signed datasets), sharding strategies, and any labeling or synthetic data generation/simulation techniques.

3. **Data Analysis**: Provide a set of descriptive statistics on the included features and configurable slices of the data. Identify outliers.

4. **Data Transformation**: Document the data conversions and feature wrangling techniques (e.g., feature to-integer mappings) used, as well as any outliers that were programmatically eliminated.

5. **Data Validation**: Apply validation to the data based on a versioned, succinct description of the expected properties of the data. Use schemas to prevent bad behavior, such as training on deprecated data. Provide mechanisms to generate the first version of the schema (e.g., `select * from foo limit 30`) that can be used to drive other platform components, such as automatic feature-engineering or data-analysis tools.

6. **Data Splitting (including partitioning)**: Record how the data is split into training, validation, hold back, and debugging sets, along with the results of validation for statistics of each set. Use metadata to detect leakage of training data into testing data and/or overfitting.

7. **Model Training/Tuning**: Capture metadata about how the model is packaged and the distribution strategy, hyperparameters searched and results of the search, results of any conversions to other model serving formats (e.g., TF -> ONNX), and techniques used to quantize/compress/prune the model and the results.

8. **Model Evaluation/Validation**: Record the results of evaluation and validation of models to ensure they meet the original codified objectives before serving them to users. Compute metrics on slices of data, both for improving performance and avoiding bias (e.g., gender A gets significantly better results than gender B). Document the source of data used for validation.

9. **Test**: Record the results of final confirmation for the model on the hold back data set. This MUST BE A SEPARATE STEP FROM #8. Document the source of data used for the final test.

10. **Model Packaging**: Capture metadata about the model package, including additional security constraints, monitoring agents, signing, etc. Provide descriptions of the necessary infrastructure (e.g., P100s, 16 GB of RAM, etc.).

11. **Serving**: Record the results of rolling the model out to production.

12. **Monitoring**: Provide live queryable metadata that enables liveness checking and ML-specific signals that need action, such as significant deviation from previous model performance or degradation of the model performance over time. Include a rollback strategy (e.g., if this model is failing, use `model last-year.last-month.pkl`).

13. **Logging**: Generate an NCSA-style record per inference request, including a cryptographically secure record of the version of the pipeline (including features) and data used to train.

By capturing and managing metadata at each stage of the ML lifecycle, MLSpec aims to provide a comprehensive and standardized approach to ensuring the reproducibility, interpretability, and governance of end-to-end machine learning workflows.

## Enhancing Model Interpretability and Trust

One of the key challenges in the adoption and deployment of machine learning models is their interpretability and the trust users place in them. Many ML models are often considered "black boxes," making it difficult for users to understand how they arrive at their predictions or decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to a lack of trust and hesitation in relying on these models, especially in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems.

MLSpec aims to address this challenge by providing a framework for building interpretable and transparent ML workflows. By standardizing the end-to-end ML lifecycle and promoting best practices for model development, evaluation, and deployment, MLSpec enables users to gain insights into the behavior and decision-making process of ML models.

Some of the ways MLSpec promotes model interpretability and trust include:

1. **Standardized Model Metadata**: MLSpec defines a standard schema for capturing and storing metadata about ML models, including information about their architecture, training data, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. This metadata provides a clear and comprehensive view of the model's characteristics and behavior.

2. **Model Evaluation and Validation**: MLSpec emphasizes rigorous model evaluation and validation practices to ensure that models meet the desired performance criteria and are free from biases or unintended consequences. By standardizing evaluation metrics and techniques, MLSpec enables users to assess the reliability and trustworthiness of models objectively.

3. **Model Explainability Techniques**: MLSpec encourages the use of model explainability techniques, such as feature importance analysis, partial dependence plots, and counterfactual explanations, to provide insights into how models make predictions. These techniques help users understand the factors influencing model decisions and identify potential issues or biases.

4. **Governance and Auditing**: MLSpec includes mechanisms for model governance and auditing, allowing organizations to track and monitor the lifecycle of ML models. This includes capturing information about model lineage, versioning, and approvals, ensuring that models adhere to regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

By focusing on model interpretability and trust, MLSpec aims to foster the responsible development and deployment of ML models. It provides the necessary tools and guidelines to build transparent and accountable ML workflows, enabling users to have confidence in the models they use and the decisions they make.
